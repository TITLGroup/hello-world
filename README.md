# hello-world
My first GitHub project

Hi there,

I am completely new to GitHub. I have some programming experience mainly in Java. I've done work in Oracle written HTML, CSS and JavaScript and am looking for ways to take my knowledge and skills to the next level and actually do something worthwhile.
